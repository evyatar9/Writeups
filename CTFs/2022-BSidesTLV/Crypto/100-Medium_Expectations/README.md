## Medium_Expectations Solution

By observing the attached file we can see the following code:
```python
import random
import hashlib
import flag

START_NUM_OF_PEOPLE = 60
PERFECT_SHOW = 2000
MAX_NUM_GAMES = 3000
RIGHT_GUESS = 60
WRONG_GUESS = 1
NUM_OF_SUITS = 4
NUM_OF_VALUES = 13

WELCOME_TEXT = """
You are a mentalist and now it's your show!
It's your chance to make the impossible possible!
Currently there are {} people in the show.
Your goal is to have {} people in it!

You can do it!
Magic is real!!
"""

SESSION_TEXT = """
There are {} people in the show
You pick a volunteer

You ask her to think on a card
"""

THINK_OF_A_SUIT_TEXT = """
You ask her to think on the suit of the card

    1) Spades
    2) Hearts
    3) Clubs
    4) Diamond
"""

THINK_OF_A_VALUE_TEXT = """
You ask her to think on the value of the card
Value between 1 and 13 when:
    1 is Ace

    13 is King

"""

RIGHT_GUESS_TEXT = """

The applause you get attracts {} more people to the show!
"""

WRONG_GUESS_TEXT = """

"""

WIN_TEXT = "You Won! Here is your flag:"

LOSE_TEXT = """No one left in the show :(

"""

def red(text):
    return "\033[91m" + text + "\033[0m"

def green(text):
    return "\033[92m" + text + "\033[0m"

def purple(text):
    return "\033[95m" + text + "\033[0m"

# return a number between 1 and the given range
def rand_range(rng):
    return rng - random.randrange(rng)

def get_int(rng):
    while True:
        num_str = input(">> ")
        if not num_str.isdigit():
            print("Not a number, try again :/")
            continue
        num = int(num_str)
        if num <= 0 or num > rng:
            print(f"Not in range, choose between 1 and {rng}")
            continue
        break
    return num

def run_game():
    random.seed(int(hashlib.md5(b"magic_is_real").hexdigest(), 16))

    people = START_NUM_OF_PEOPLE

    print(WELCOME_TEXT.format(people, PERFECT_SHOW))

    for i in range(MAX_NUM_GAMES):
        if people <= 0:
            print(red(LOSE_TEXT))
            break
        if people >= PERFECT_SHOW:
            print(green(WIN_TEXT))
            print(flag.FLAG)
            break

        print(SESSION_TEXT.format(purple(str(people))))

        print(THINK_OF_A_SUIT_TEXT)
        rand_suit = rand_range(NUM_OF_SUITS)
        suit = get_int(NUM_OF_SUITS)

        print(THINK_OF_A_VALUE_TEXT)
        rand_value = rand_range(NUM_OF_VALUES)
        value = get_int(NUM_OF_VALUES)

        if suit == rand_suit and value == rand_value:
            print(green(RIGHT_GUESS_TEXT.format(RIGHT_GUESS)))
            people += RIGHT_GUESS
        else:
            print(red(WRONG_GUESS_TEXT))
            people -= WRONG_GUESS
    else:
        print("Sorry... the crowd is bored")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_game()
```

We can see the ```run_game``` function following ```random.seed(int(hashlib.md5(b"magic_is_real").hexdigest(), 16))```.

Isn't random because we know the seed ```int(hashlib.md5(b"magic_is_real").hexdigest(), 16)``` meaning that the numbers always be the same.

We can solve it using the following code with [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/):
```python
from pwn import *
import random
import hashlib

NUM_OF_SUITS = 4
NUM_OF_VALUES = 13

# return a number between 1 and the given range
def rand_range(rng):
    return rng - random.randrange(rng)

p = remote('medium-expectations.ctf.bsidestlv.com', 8642)
random.seed(int(hashlib.md5(b"magic_is_real").hexdigest(), 16))

while True:
    rand_suit = rand_range(NUM_OF_SUITS)
    rand_value = rand_range(NUM_OF_VALUES)
    #print(p.recvuntil('>'))
    print(p.recvline())
    p.sendline(str(rand_suit))
    p.sendline(str(rand_value))
```

We create the same random.

Run it:

```

And we get the flag ```BSidesTLV2022{r3ad1ing_mind5_is_e4sy}```.
